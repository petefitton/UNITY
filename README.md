# UNITY
### A game where there shall be only ONE!!1

I want to make a grayscale, turn-based RPG game

Tech involved includes basic HTML, CSS, and JS.  One stretch goal includes the addition of a simple World Map which may require the use of HTML5 Canvas.  Most of the game's tech will deal with functions and objects as well as DOM queries.

The MVP is a start screen with a play game button followed by a short amount of story and then a single battle followed by a small amount of story + credits.
Further information can be expounded upon (game mechanics).
There will also be an options page on the start screen where you can affect audio volume levels for music and SFX. Audio will likely be used only for non-commercial purposes.

Stretch Goals in order of importance:

Battle animations when taking actions
Second battle - including a new action for the protagonist (level up after 1st battle)
Third battle - includes a fourth new action (level up after 2nd battle)
Mobile Friendly
World Map
Battle only version of the game which skips the story, accessible after beating the game
Spruce up the visual components
Create original audio/music
Playable with only arrow keys rather than mouse clicks (how can I make it more accessible? can I assign alt names to the action buttons in the battle in order to have action names listed out?)
Make the background video
