            one div for "click/tap anywhere to start"
        one set of divs for the main menu screen
            background set on this div ^^^ (probably background image rather than solid black)
            one div for the title
            one div for play game button
            one div for options button
        one set of divs for the options screen

                four divs for the four possible actions
            one div for enemy stats
                div for name
                div for HP
                div for SP in 1D

        one set of divs for the second battle screen STRETCH GOAL
            same as first battle screen
            except enemy stat box should have an additional div for SP 2D
                this might mean the enemy stat box might need to be larger
        one set of divs for the third battle screen STRETCH GOAL
            same as first battle screen
            except enemy stat box should have an additional div for SP 3D

            background on ^^^^^
            one div for player
            one div for enemy
            should I make any other things that are not the background?
        one set of divs for the full background
        I think the way I would like to do the background is to create a video with some animation software and then just call it
        as a single object
            I think the way I would like to make the dots and lines move in the background is to have individual divs
                for each that
            Actually after typing that out, it would probably be easiest for me to just make a video that loops
                Not sure what the easiest way to do that is though.
                But I'm not sure how easy it would be to smoothly move so many divs in different ways continuously through the game

        one set of divs for the credits screen
            background on ^^^^^
            one div for UNITY
            one div for made by PF
            one div for audio taken from/made by
            possibly one div for images by PF
