Any sounds that have "1" or "2" or anything after their original name are extra or split parts of an single or multi-turn attack. 

If a sound has "direct" or a "D"after its name, that means I was unsure if the created sound from combining all the parts of the sound, sounded the same to the direct version. (So its there for comparison)  There some extras here and there.
