/* Styling for centering the main div and media queries for mobile first based development
    mobile should force to landscape orientation
    browsers should easily be able to be resized with gameplay staying centered
    main gameplay div will need an exact width and height
        I need to figure out that number as that will be pretty important

h1 tag for title & Main Menu screen should be text-aligend center
h6 tag for elems on main menu screen should be text-aligend center

all elements on each type of screen will need to be set to their specific location in the gameplay screen 

how do I want to handle animations?
    static animation vs battle action animation
    static = probably JS with some random activity that bounds back to center fairly quickly (small movements and at random intervals)
    battle action = probably JS too
